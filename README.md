### Hi there! 👋

I'm Alexander. I work as a full-time web-developer. In my spare time I do open-sourcing (normally it is about 1-2 hours in the morning). Most of my open-source projects below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing - to help people learn 📚.

- I’m currently working and testing on Web-Sites and Apps;
- I’m learning: «You Dont Know JS», «Don’t Make Me Think», «How Google tests Software»;
